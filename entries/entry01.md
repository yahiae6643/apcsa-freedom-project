My partner and I decided to make a product for the use of entertainment. After abit of thinking, we decided to make a game. There are many tools that allow us to create games and people who play games are mostly people of our age. We later chose our game to be a RPG, for that allows the player to make their own decisions and deeply interact with the game. Another reason is that we really enjoy RPGs. There were many resources to allow us to create a RPG game, but most weren't free and very complex to use. As a result, we decided on using a program called Unity. Unity is free, has a user friendly interface, and the code involved to use it is simple to learn.
