My partner and I decided to make a product for the use of entertainment. After thinking about the different types of entertainment, we decided to make a game. Games are a very popular choice of entertainment that target people of our age and there are many tools that allows us to create them. We later chose our game to be a RPG, for that allows the player to make their own decisions and deeply interact with the game. Another reason is that we really enjoy RPGs. There were many resources to allow us to create a RPG game, but most weren't free and very complex to use. As a result, we decided on using a program called Unity. Unity is free, has a user friendly interface, and the code involved to use it is simple to learn.
