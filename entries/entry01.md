During my regular class of computer science, the whole class was introduced a new project called "The Freedom Project". Essentially, students had to create a unique product that people would find useful or fun. The product should be created with new tools that we weren't exposed to. Swift, Swing, Vue, and Typescript are a few examples of these tools. 

Once the project was announced, I quickly paired up with my friend, Jagger D'Ugo, and brainstormed about the product we should create. We wanted to create a product that brings joy to the people who use it. It should be fun and appeal to people in our age group. After some thinking, we simplified those thoughts to the idea of entertainment. We wanted to make a product that can entertain our young users, so it was quickly decided that our product should be a game. They are a source of mindless fun and is often used by teenagers and young adults, so it was the perfect choice. 

In addition, the game was quickly chosen to be a mix of action and RPG. This is due to action and RPG being two of most popular game genres. 

Now with an idea, we needed a program to create it. 

List of programs found:

* Construct 2 (https://www.scirra.com/construct2)
* RPG Maker (https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/)
* Unreal Engine (https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)
* PlayCanvas (https://playcanvas.com/)
* Unity (https://unity.com/)

There were many resources to allow us to create a RPG game, but most weren't free or very complex to use. Out of all of the programs we found, Unity was the one that stood out from the rest. The program was completely free and had a very simple interface. The program doesn't use many resources from the computer to function (RAM & CPU usage was completely normal). As a plus, the coding language involved with the program was C#, a language very similar to Java. This means we will have less difficulty in learning the program. 

As of 10/19/2019, my partner and I decided on using Unity to create our RPG and action game.
