## Summary

Throughout the middle of January to now, Jagger and I test the game-creating software, [**Unity**](https://unity.com "Unity").

## The Engineering Design Process (EDP)

In our previous blog entry, it was stated that Jagger and I **brainstormed** and **planned** our game's functionality and design. Now, I am proud to say that we have now reached the **prototype** stage of our Engineering Design Process.

Ideally, this is where we implant our ideas into our software and make a prototype. However, we quickly ran into an issue; the issue being procrastination. The long holidays and weeks without schools distracted us from our goal of completing the prototype. We didn't prioritize nor organized the prototype of our game. The first half of January was unproductive. Fortunately, both of us immediately went back to working on the game after the break.

Jagger and I installed the latest version of Unity, its multiple libraries (different types of source code that serve different purposes), and a premade Unity game onto our personal and school computers. Upon opening the software, we were exposed to a very simple interface.

Unity's interface consists of five parts: ***The Toolbar, The Scene View, The Project Window, The Hierarchy Window, and The Inspector Window.***

***The Toolbar is where you have access to basic features.***
- On the left, you are given tools that allow you to manipulate the scene view and the objects within it.
- The middle of the toolbar illustrates buttons that allow you to run or pause your project.
- The right of the toolbar gives you access to your Unity account and Unity services.

***The Scene View is where your project and its objects are displayed, either in 2D or 3D***

***The Project Window is where your assets (textures, colors, animations, etc) are displayed***

***The Hierarchy Window shows an organized list of your project's objects. They are organized based on how recent they were created***
- The newest object is the lowest of the hierarchy, so it's placed on the bottom of the list
- The oldest object is the highest of the hierarchy, so it's placed on the top of the list

***The Inspector Window gives you access to edit the properties of all of your objects within the project***
- [**Variables**](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/variables-and-functions "Variables")
- [**Color**](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html "Color")
- [**Camera / Perspective**](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.html "Camera")  (At what direction and angle the object is displayed)
- [**Position**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html "Position")
- [**Size / Scale**](https://forum.unity.com/threads/understanding-scale-in-unity.7314/ "Scaling")

On the inspector window, my partner and I were given access to tutorials on how to change the objects and behaviors within our downloaded example game. We were both ignorant about how to use Unity, so Jagger and I decided to go through them.

Due to Unity's simple interface, it wasn't very difficult to complete them all.

However, we are still trying to get used to being familiar with our tool for us to begin creating a prototype and reach the middle of the prototype stage. Jagger and I are still learning more about Unity, either through youtube videos and experimenting with the premade Unity games.

Currently, in our EDP, Jagger and I are in the early beginning stages of creating a prototype.


## Skills

I would say Jagger and I used our skills on **How to learn** and **How to Google**. Unity was a completely new thing for both of us, so we were determined to be proficient in using the software. We had to develop the habit of experimenting with existing Unity games; changing the games' colors, variable values, and perspective. Experimentation has its perks, but it doesn't us all of Unity's mechanics. As a result, we learned how to google certain things relating to Unity to fill in our knowledge gaps.

A few examples of what we searched:
- "2d terrain in unity"
- "unity assets"
- "animation in unity"
- "pixel art for unity"

## Knowledge

As Jagger and I learned about the interface of [**Unity**](https://unity.com "Unity"), we realized that Unity has a big similarity with the regular program we use in class, [**CS50**](ide.cs50.io "CS50"). The similarity is that both have an IDE.

</p>

When we double-click a file within the hierarchy window, both programs open the file within a text editor (otherwise known as an IDE). This is great because Jagger and I won't need to download a separate IDE to edit certain files for our prototype. Also, the coding process of our project will be more efficient and streamlined.


## Final Words

Again, Jagger and I still have a long way to go from creating a proper RPG. Over the next week, we will continue to be going through tutorials on our own. This will allow us to finally understand how to use Unity to the fullest. Once we have a solid understanding of Unity, our goal will be to create the prototype of our game. However, this will require us to be very organized since we need to plan the creation of our prototype throughout the few weeks we have before the next blog entry.
