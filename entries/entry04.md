## Summary

Throughout the middle of January to now, Jagger and I test the game-creating software, [**Unity**](https://unity.com "Unity").

## The Engineering Design Process (EDP)

In our previous blog entry, it was stated that Jagger and I **brainstormed** and **planned** our game's functionality and design. Now, I am proud to say that we have now reached the **prototype** stage of our Engineering Design Process.

Ideally, this is where we implant our ideas into our software and make a prototype. However, we quickly ran into a issue; the issue being procastination. The long holidays and weeks without schools distracted us from our goal of completing the prototype. We didn't prioritized nor organized the prototype of our game. The first-half of January was unproductive. Fortunately, both of us immediately went back to working on the game after the break.

Jagger and I installed the latest version of Unity and its multiple libraries (different types of source code that serve different purposes) onto our personal and school computers. Upon opening the software, we were exposed to a very simple interface.

Unity's interface consist of five parts: ***The Toolbar, The Scene View, The Project Window, The Hierarchy Window, and The Inspector Window.***

***The Toolbar is where your have access to basic features.***
- On the left, you are given tools that allow you manipulate the scene view and the objects within it.
- The middle of the toolbar illustrates buttons that allow you to run or pause your project.
- The right of the toolbar gives you access to your Unity account and Unity services.

***The Scene View is where your project and its objects are displayed, either in 2D or 3D***

***The Project Window is where your assets (textures, colors, animations, etc) are displayed**

***The Hierarchy Window shows a organized list of your project's objects. They are organized based on how recent they were created***
- The newest object is the lowest of the hierachy, so it's placed on the bottom of the list
- The oldest object is the highest of the hierachy, so it's placed on the top of the list

***The Inspector Window gives you access to edit the properties of all of your objects within the project***
- Variables
- Color
- Camera (At what direction and angle the object is displayed)
- Position
- Size / Scale
