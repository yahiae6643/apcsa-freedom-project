## Summary

Throughout the month of december, my partner, Jagger, and I attempted to learn the coding language C# and outlined our prototype.

## The Engineering Design Process (EDP)

Throughout the time of learning C#, we were **brainstorming** and **planning** different designs and features for our prototype. The process consisted of mostly sketching and typing onto a google document.

During our **brainstorming stage** We sketched designs for how our prototype would look like. Since the prototype is going to be a RPG (role-playing game), we made sure to include essential RPG elements within our sketches. This includes:

- Meters and numbers that measure the player's resources (Health, Mana, Inventory)
- Boxes that appear when the user interacts with a character or item within the game
- Possible terrians that the user can encounter and explore

Once we completed our final sketch, we start our **planning** stage. Jagger and I created a google document where we created C# variables that would needed to implement our sketch onto Unity. Different elements of our sketch required different C# variables, so we decided on using:

- Integer variables for health, mana, and inventory
- String variables for chatboxes and item descriptions
- Boolean variables for checking if the user is interacting in any way (fighting, talking, etc)

We are still currently planning out our C# variables. Once completed, we'll quickly onto **creating** our prototype since we'll have a reference and some code to start off with.

## Skills

Jagger and I have used our skills of **collaboration** and **time-management** while approaching our project.

A majority of our time in class was utilized to fix an persistent issue with Unity. The school computers weren't able to install the software. Our attempts to fix the installation issue failed, and after one week of constant debugging, Jagger and I finally decide to focus our energy on blueprinting our prototype and learning C#.

During the rest of december, we used our class-time and some time outside of class to develop a solid understanding of C#. We went through w3schools and many other resources about the coding language. Our lessons on C# ranged from syntax to classes. After finishing our lessons, we discussed what we learned and asked questions to fill in any knowledge gaps.

While developing a solid understanding of C#, we also discussed possible designs and features that should be added into our prototype (Go the EDP section above to see more about our brainstorming and planning).


## Knowledge

As stated in our previous entry, we noticed that Java and C# are very similar. This comes from the fact that both are object-oriented languages. Both coding languages function through the use of classes and methods, which is very important when creating a game. However, the main factor that differentates C# from Java is that it is also a managed language. This means C# has strong memory backup, which prevents memory leakage problems and other memory issues from occuring. These type of problems often happen when using Java and may lead to our software to shutdown when testing our game prototype, so C# is the ideal coding language for Jagger and I to use.

## Final Words

Jagger and I still have a long way to go from creating a proper RPG.
