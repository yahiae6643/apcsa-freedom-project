# APCSA Freedom Project
by Yahia Elhag & Jagger Dugo

## Context
The basic gist of the "Freedom Project" is that an individual or group is allowed to create a product with any programs or tools they desire. However, the product should be useful or have some social/global/economic impact. You can't make anything that doesn't serve a purpose. You need to take account of many factors to make a good product, such as the benefits your product brings and the type of people who will use your product.

## Content
My partner and I decided to make a product for the use of entertainment. After thinking about the different types of entertainment, we decided to make a game. Games are a very popular choice of entertainment that target people of our age and there are many tools that allows us to create them. We later chose our game to be a RPG, for that allows the player to make their own decisions and deeply interact with the game. Another reason is that we really enjoy RPGs. There were many resources to allow us to create a RPG game, but most weren't free and very complex to use. As a result, we decided on using a program called Unity. Unity is free, has a user friendly interface, and the code involved to use it is simple to learn.

## Implications
The product impacts our users socially. It gives them a source of entertainment and allows them to have fun. Since the game is a RPG, it allows the users to think and make decisions on what they believe will allow them to progress.
