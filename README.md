# APCSA Freedom Project
by Yahia Elhag & Jagger Dugo

## Context
The basic gist of the "Freedom Project" is that an individual or group is allowed to create a product with any programs or tools they desire. However, the product should be useful or have some social/global/economic impact. You can't make anything that doesn't serve a purpose. You need to take account of many factors to make a good product, such as the benefits your product brings and the type of people who will use your product.

## Content
My partner and I decided on making an RPG game as our product. We chose to make a RPG game because it's a great source of entertainment. To create the game, we needed to decide on a simple and free tool that allows us to create it. After researching, our tool was chosen to be "Unity". The free program allowed us to make stunning games and didn't have a steep learning curve. Our product will target people of young age (Preteen to Young Adult).

## Implications
The product impacts our users socially. It gives them a source of entertainment and allows them to have fun. Since the game is a RPG, it allows the users to think and make decisions on what they believe will allow them to progress.
